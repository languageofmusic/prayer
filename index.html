<p>Evening, October 26th, 2024</p>
<p>What will it take?The day marches on, and I get hungrier and hungrier. No food, entertainment, or productive activity will satisfy. The hunger grows, until now, 11:32 pm, I feel as if I have to go to bed starving.</p>
<p>What is my hunger for? You? In my arrogance, your presence isn't enough for me. I seek things outside of you, and when they don't satisfy, I seek them more and more. Even now, I'm seeking. Hoping this writing will satisfy. That it will give me fame and recognition, respect and influence. These things are not you. I do not need them.</p>
<p>Help me see that I only need you. You are enough. In every breath, I am satisfied. Complete. There is nothing to do, or prove. You are everything, right now.</p>
<p>Make me anew. So that I can see, hear, and understand.</p>
<br>
<p>Afternoon, October 26th, 2024</p>
<p>You are here. You are good. I breathe you in, and you breathe through me. Thank you.</p>
<p>May this day bring peace, connection, and hope. Peace in myself, in awareness of you in every moment. Connection with my mom, nature, and steph. Hope for me in my relationship with you. That it grows stronger and I grow stronger through it. Deliver me from the evil one. Like the messiah Jesus.</p>

<p>Afternoon, October 25th, 2024</p>
<p>Thank you for being with me at work. There were a few moments when I felt it. I wish I felt you more. I was rushing, trying to get things done quickly. Writing to you is a good thing.</p>
<p>I'm grateful to have something to do this evening. I won't lose myself. In these two hours I have on my own, help me rest. At the concert, help me see the beauty in everyone. They are all images of you. If there is someone there you want me to connect with, help me find the right words.</p>
<p>May your kingdom come, and your desire come true. Yahweh, through the messiah Jesus.</p>

<p>Morning, October 25th, 2024</p>
<p>God, this is my way of talking to you. I know it's weird. You know it's weird. You know me. 
    You know that I had the idea for this last night, and I can't resist doing it first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>This is my problem. I can't resist myself. My brain pulls me forward all day, in constant action.
    But sometimes it pulls me toward things I don't want to do. Things you told me not to do.</p>
<p>It would be better for me to do nothing. But I don't know how to do nothing. I take my phone to the bathroom because I can't stand to sit on the toilet without being entertained.</p>
<p>Please, help me rest. Help me rest in you. You are with me in every moment. Help me find joy in your presence. In the name of Jesus.</p>
