<p>Morning, November 19th</p>
<p>Give me a new heart and a new spirit, so I will know what you want me to do. Let me rejoice in whatever you have planned for me, however small, however menial.</p>
<p>For you are the creator, and where I don't know, you do.</p>
<br>
<p>Morning, November 15th, 2024</p>
<p>I am afraid of running out of money. This fear runs my life. Everyday, I wonder what I can do to make money. I try things and they don't work. The only thing that works is something I don't want to do.</p>
<p>Did you want to be a brick layer, when you came all those years ago? Did you enjoy it? Perhaps not. But when the time was right, you stopped laying bricks and did what you were sent here to do. Then, you didn't care about money.</p>
<p>Help me serve you first, and only. You will clothe me and feed me. When you give me important things to do, I will know it. Please give me my tasks today. Guide my feet as I run this race.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>Afternoon, November 5th, 2024</p>
<p>Lot's of people need you today. Some are afraid, some have false hope. Help us all to see that your ways are not our ways.</p>
<p>Some of us think we have the answers, and those answers give us grief, or hope, in false things. Help us all to see the truth. Which is that we don't know what's coming. We only know that we should face it head on with you, and with love.</p>
<br>
<p>Evening, November 4th, 2024</p>
<p>I'm stuck. I can't do it on my own. I'm always focussed on my own desires. I ask the wrong questions, always wondering what I should do next. I don't know what to do next, and I never will, unless you give me a new heart.</p>
<p>Give me a new heart. I'm dying. Everyday, I die, because I won't lay down my life for you. Help me surrender, and live. Everyday.</p>
<br>
<p>Afternoon, November 3rd, 2024</p>
<p>I don't know anything. But my mind can play tricks on me. Sometimes it spins a tale about your world, and your ways, and I think I understand. Perhaps, sometimes, I do. You gave me this mind, and it is good.</p>
<p>But help me to remember that I do not know. Help me hold my thoughts lightly, as I try to understand you. Full understanding is not only of the mind, but of the heart, body, soul, nefesh.</p>
<p>Thanks you for this life, and all you've given me.</p>
<br>
<p>Afternoon, October 31st, 2024</p>
<p>Tell me what to do. Take control of my life. Help me surrender to you, for I am afraid. Would I follow you if it meant giving away all my money? I don't have that much faith.</p>
<p>Forgive me, for I am trying. Give me the courage I lack. Help me discern who you are, and who you are not.</p>
<br>
<p>Evening, October 28th, 2024</p>
<p>Facebook tells me that on this day in 2016, I committed to ending all digital distractions. I failed. Then I committed again, and failed again. And again, and again. It is now a weekly occurance. Is there no hope? Is it too hard for me?</p>
<p>It is the easiest thing in the world. I only need to breathe. I breathe all the time, and that's all I need to do. Breathe you in. Rejoice in your love.</p>
<p>So now I begin again. With your help, I will heal, and live. I will eat from the tree of your presence.</p>
<br>
<p>Morning, October 28th, 2024</p>
<p>I have a hard time with mornings. My brain doesn't work as well. I can't focus. I try to breathe you in, but stillness doesn't come. Odd, that a tired brain is overactive.</p>
<p>My mind wandered just now. I'll try to come back to you throughout the day. To remember that I am in the garden. Nothing is missing. There is no rush. Everything will be ok.</p>
<p>Come to me and bring me peace.</p>
<br>
<p>Evening, October 27th, 2024</p>
<p>Your word is holy. And what does it say about me? It had to be universal. Applicable for millenia. Of course our modern specifics aren't included. The internet. Dopamine. Isolation.</p>
<p>Your word is good. But I fall short. Forgive me, if you deem it necessary. Help me understand if it is. I need you. Help me keep my wanderings short, so I come back to you often.</p>
<p>If you desire, give me a dream. Help me sleep. I will come to you in the morning.</p>
<br>
<p>Evening, October 26th, 2024</p>
<p>What will it take?The day marches on, and I get hungrier and hungrier. No food, entertainment, or productive activity will satisfy. The hunger grows, until now, 11:32 pm, I feel as if I have to go to bed starving.</p>
<p>What is my hunger for? You? In my arrogance, your presence isn't enough for me. I seek things outside of you, and when they don't satisfy, I seek them more and more. Even now, I'm seeking. Hoping this writing will satisfy. That it will give me fame and recognition, respect and influence. These things are not you. I do not need them.</p>
<p>Help me see that I only need you. You are enough. In every breath, I am satisfied. Complete. There is nothing to do, or prove. You are everything, right now.</p>
<p>Make me anew. So that I can see, hear, and understand.</p>
<br>
<p>Afternoon, October 26th, 2024</p>
<p>You are here. You are good. I breathe you in, and you breathe through me. Thank you.</p>
<p>May this day bring peace, connection, and hope. Peace in myself, in awareness of you in every moment. Connection with my mom, nature, and steph. Hope for me in my relationship with you. That it grows stronger and I grow stronger through it. Deliver me from the evil one. Like the messiah Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>Afternoon, October 25th, 2024</p>
<p>Thank you for being with me at work. There were a few moments when I felt it. I wish I felt you more. I was rushing, trying to get things done quickly. Writing to you is a good thing.</p>
<p>I'm grateful to have something to do this evening. I won't lose myself. In these two hours I have on my own, help me rest. At the concert, help me see the beauty in everyone. They are all images of you. If there is someone there you want me to connect with, help me find the right words.</p>
<p>May your kingdom come, and your desire come true. Yahweh, through the messiah Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>Morning, October 25th, 2024</p>
<p>God, this is my way of talking to you. I know it's weird. You know it's weird. You know me. 
    You know that I had the idea for this last night, and I can't resist doing it first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>This is my problem. I can't resist myself. My brain pulls me forward all day, in constant action.
    But sometimes it pulls me toward things I don't want to do. Things you told me not to do.</p>
<p>It would be better for me to do nothing. But I don't know how to do nothing. I take my phone to the bathroom because I can't stand to sit on the toilet without being entertained.</p>
<p>Please, help me rest. Help me rest in you. You are with me in every moment. Help me find joy in your presence. In the name of Jesus.</p>
