<p>Morning, October 25th, 2024</p>
<p>God, this is my way of talking to you. I know it's weird. You know it's weird. You know me. 
    You know that I had the idea for this last night, and I can't resist doing it first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>This is my problem. I can't resist myself. My brain pulls me forward all day, in constant action.
    But sometimes it pulls me toward things I don't want to do. Things you told me not to do.</p>
<p>It would be better for me to do nothing. But I don't know how to do nothing. I take my phone to the bathroom because I can't stand to sit on the toilet without being entertained.</p>
<p>Please, help me rest. Help me rest in you. You are with me in every moment. Help me find joy in your presence. In the name of Jesus.</p>
