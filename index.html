<p>Afternoon, October 25th, 2024</p>
<p>Thank you for being with me at work. There were a few moments when I felt it. I wish I felt you more. I was rushing, trying to get things done quickly. Writing to you is a good thing.</p>
<p>I'm grateful to have something to do this evening. I won't lose myself. In these two hours I have on my own, help me rest. At the concert, help me see the beauty in everyone. They are all images of you. If there is someone there you want me to connect with, help me find the right words.</p>
<p>May your kingdom come, and your desire come true. Yahweh, through the messiah Jesus.</p>

<p>Morning, October 25th, 2024</p>
<p>God, this is my way of talking to you. I know it's weird. You know it's weird. You know me. 
    You know that I had the idea for this last night, and I can't resist doing it first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>This is my problem. I can't resist myself. My brain pulls me forward all day, in constant action.
    But sometimes it pulls me toward things I don't want to do. Things you told me not to do.</p>
<p>It would be better for me to do nothing. But I don't know how to do nothing. I take my phone to the bathroom because I can't stand to sit on the toilet without being entertained.</p>
<p>Please, help me rest. Help me rest in you. You are with me in every moment. Help me find joy in your presence. In the name of Jesus.</p>
